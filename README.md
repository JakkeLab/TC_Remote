<H3>A remote controller for enhancing trimble connect's features.</H3>

<H3>Background</H3>
- I'm now working as BIM engineer at work. One day, my teammate get tired of moving objects (drawings, 3D model files) in Trimble Connect.
  I've caught it and started to build an application to enhance the UX of trimble connect.

<H3>What to build</H3>
1) Windows : WPF Based application. Connecting the "Trimble Connect desktop client" running on. <br>
2) Cross platform : Electron based application. Connecting to Trimble Connect server which requires authentication by login.


<H3>What features to add</H3>
<ul>
  <li>Set multiple object's position at once</li>
  <li>Set multiple object's parameter at once</li>
  <li>Get multiple object's parameter at once, as tables</li>
  <li>Save the status of object hide, not viewport</li>
</ul>
